Warm Fuzzies
=============

Let us get to know you a bit better. Please answer the following:

1. When can you start?

 I could start in about 2 hours, although I still have some obligations towards school for another couple of weeks (excluding weekends of course).

2. What is your ideal weekly schedule?

  Thanks to some fantastic scheduling, I will soon be free from school on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and weekends! Ideally, I would arrive some time around 9am on the weekdays and really get to work around 9:30 (also am). I would then have a blast at work and (reluctantly) go home between 6 and 8 o'clock. On the weekends, I like to picture a later start or even a day off to get ready for the awesome week that lies ahead.

3. What is your desired compensation range? Range = (least you are comfortable accepting, max you think you are worth)

  I've been working for under $10.00/hour for a couple of years now. Even though the job is really fun, I've come to realize that $12.00/hour would already be a pretty awesome raise. That being said, my friend just got a job at an oil company making $102k/year, and I'm pretty sure we have similar experience. So if you ever start an open-source oil refinery, I'd have to politely ask you to match her salary.

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly, dog-filled environment. Are you comfortable working around dogs? If you have a dog, would you see yourself bringing your dog to work?

  WOOF! (Yes, I absolutely love dogs and working around them. My sister has a two-year-old golden retriever named Juneau. I'm pretty sure she's a vegan canine but she doesn't bark to everybody about it. If my sister ever needs me to watch Juneau, I would be very excited to introduce her to everybody.)

5. Who is your cultural alter-ego (athlete, artist, author, actor, alien, etc.)? 

  The great Richard Feynman. He's as incredible as any fictional character I could think of. Even though I don't pretend to be even close to his brilliance, I like to think that I have the same passion for a wide variety of things that aren't typically connected. I'm also inspired by his ability to find humor in any situation and his cool *nerdy-scientific* charisma that made him a friend to everyone.

6. What topics would you like to focus on while working with the engineering team? 

  Even though I really enjoy prototyping and putting things together like circuits and mechanical systems, writing documents regarding technical subjects for people who may not be familiar with them also seems particularly enticing. That being said, debugging and touching up code is something that I wouldn't mind doing whenever it is needed.
